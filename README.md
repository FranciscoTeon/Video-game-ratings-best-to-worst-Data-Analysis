# Video-game-ratings-best-to-worst-Data-Analysis
1. Summarize the specifics of what you did in the cleaning and analysis steps.
   For the cleaning portion of the dataset, we dropped all missing values, removed duplicates, removed outliers, normalized columns, encoded categories, renamed columns as well as removed columns that have a high amount of missing values, converted to the correct data types, and finally replaced values. In the data analysis step of the project, we used a variety of plots such as bar, line, and histograms, to name a few, to help answer questions that we had about our dataset. Some of the questions include, What is the distribution of game scores across the entire dataset? How many unique game titles are present in the dataset? Which platforms have the most games reviewed? What is the average score for games across all platforms?

2. List all the interesting or unexpected observations in your analysis and a possible explanation for whatâ€™s behind them
    when trying to answer what the distribution of game releases was by month we found out with the use of a bar graph that November was the month with the highest game releases, which would make sense considering that many companies release video games in time for the holidays like black Friday and Christmas. We also found that PCs were the platforms that would always have the highest number of ratings and the largest diversity of genres which can correspond to the ability of PCs to be able to run games from every other platform and games that other platforms cannot. We also found that in the years 2000 to 2010 video game releases rose significantly and peaked in 2010 for this dataset, which could correlate with the various new consoles that came out and the ability to be able to play online.
   
3. List a few more specific questions to dive deeper into for future analysis as a follow-up to what you have done here.
What game genre has been the best received throughout the years?
What game genres have been the worst received?
What combination of genres has been the best received within the higher-rated games?
