Initially, you must download the 'IGN video games from best to worst'(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/ign-games-from-best-to-worst) dataset. Using ign_cleaning.py you will be able to quickly clean the IGN dataset by importing the IGN dataset and running the cleaning script ending with a clean and refined version of the data. Next, import the clean dataset into the ign_exploration.ipynb and run the various exploration scripts to see the many insights we gathered throughout this dataset.

Our goal for this project is to find specific factors within the video game industry that make a video game highly rated. Using various cleaning and exploration techniques within our datasets we hope to pinpoint what variables within a game title lead to high ratings. These variables include game genre, game release times from years, months, days, and game platform. Our analysis should produce insights into which genres are rated higher than others or if there are any combination of genres such as action-adventure compared to the solely action genre. Also, the year, month, and day a game was released affect a game's ratings. Another insight is whether a game performs better in the charts depending on the platform it is hosted on. Finally, whether an interaction between any factors can influence its overall rating.

3-5 high-level questions:
Is there a formula of variables that leads to high ratings?
Are there certain interactions within variables that can affect a game's score?
How do platform variables such as performance affect game ratings?
